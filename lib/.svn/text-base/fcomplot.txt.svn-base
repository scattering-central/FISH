        Help file for LOQ plotting routines, very important since
        commands are stored only here.
  80  4 HELP
            Full help instructions.
  80  1 H
         Quick list, or H Command for information on any Command.
  10  1 READ
            Asks for a list of curves(sets) to be drawn, all on same  
        axes with different symbols or line types for each. 
        ( Do H SYMBOL for more info.)
  20  1 LIST
            Gives all the details input by READ and more on each curve.
  30  2 SCREEN
              Draw on screen.
  40  1 FILE
            Put out drawing to a file, for later paper plot.
  50  1 INDEX
             Usual master index of all sets in memory.
  90  4 STOP
            Returns to main LOQ routines. 
  61  3 LINEAR
              plot Y against X values just as supplied.
  62  2 LOG
           plot LOG(Y) against X, or use before other plot types to return
        to base 10 logs.
  63  2 LN
          plot LN(Y) against X, or use before other plot types to switch
        to natural (base e) logarithms.
  64  2 GUINIER
               plot LOG(Y) against X**2,  uses log to base 10 unless you
       have previously issued a LN command.
  65  1 ZIMM
            plot 1/Y against X**2.
  66  2 RODS
            plot LOG(Y*X) against X**2 for thin rods.
  67  2 SHEETS
              plot LOG(Y*(X**2)) against X**2.
  69  4 LOGLOG 
              plot LOG(Y) against LOG(X) 
  68  1 USER
            plot with your own transformations.
        These are of the form (X**i)(Y**j)LOG( (X**k)(Y**l) ) where
        i,j,k,l may be defined differently for both X and Y axes.
 100  1 FIT n m
               straight lines to be fit to sets n to m, will ask for
        X range for each set.  Will turn "off" the fit if one is
        already "on". Use LIST to see the gradient etc.
 110  2 SYMBOL
              line types LTYP are 
        1-straight line segments,   2-smooth curve(local polynomials)
        3-dashed                    4-dotted  
        5-symbols of type LSYM=  1-up triangle,  2-down triangle,
           3- + ,  4- X ,  5-square,  6-diamond, 7-circle,  8- *
        Some options may not work yet. Avoid circles and * as they
        take longer to plot.
