        ( Help file for LOQ, very important as instruction string definitions
        are read from it. Names may easily be changed, e.g. into another
        language.  The FORMAT is I4,I3,1X,72A1. The second integer is the
        minimum number of characters required. NOTE that  the comments
        sections must start after column 8. Do not use the TAB key as TAB 
        characters are not always portable to other systems.  )
 100  4 HELP
            lists the entire detailed help file.
 100  1 H
          gives a short list of commands available.
        HELP Name  or  H Name  gives information on a particular command.
        Commands may be shortened to their minimum unambiguous length.
  11  2 READ-DATA
                 read standard FISH & LOQ format, Q,I(Q),ERROR(Q) file
  12  2 GETWIR
              for BINARY linear data input, old Daresbury SAXS format in 
        file [RKH.DL]Snnnn.FV4, where nnnn is input run number.
  13  1 OTOKO
             for BINARY data, Daresbury SAX format
  14  5 READ3
             read free format 3 column Q,I(Q),ERROR(Q) file with no header
  14  2 R3
             abbreviation for READ3
  15  5 READ2
             read free format 2 column Q,I(Q) file with no header
  15  2 R2
             abbreviation for READ3
  16  2 RNILS
             read ILL, RNILS format Q,I(Q),ERROR(Q) file
  60  2 LIST
            to list data set to monitor file ( for lineprinter) or
        to write out an ASCII set to file.
  50  2 INDEX
             show details of the sets you have stored, up to 6 may be 
        present,( it works rather like a calculator memory).
  20  2 ARITHMETIC
                  add, subtract, divide, scale, normalise linear data.
  32  2 QBIN
            Bins linear data and/or recalculates Q values.
  31  2 CENTRE
              helps to find middle of Daresbury SAXS data set, asks for
        pixel range L1,L2 to left of beam stop and a guess for mid-point
        Then it sums (N(R)-N(L) )**2 over R corresponding to L =L1,L2
        where N(i) is the count per channel. A small range of mid-points
        is chosen, the "best" may be at the minimum sum. Use with care
        and plot results to test !!!
  33  1 L-R
           Put Left-Right differences for a Daresbury SAXS set into another
        data set, e.g. ready to plot.
  34  2 RANGE n
            Reset pixel range to be used in fits or plots for set n.
  35  1 WTMEAN
              To calculate weight means etc. from a polydispersity.
  36  3 GRIMSON
               Special calculations for Malcom Grimson, polydisperse hard
        spheres with excess surfactant micelles.
  37  1 DESMEAR
               Desmearing using Vonk method, J.Appl.Cryst. 4(1971)p340.
  40  1 PLOT
          Enters longwinded, complicated, but very flexible plot routine.
        First you will need to set up a list of sets to plot, several can be
        placed on the same axes.  If in doubt about optional parameters enter
        zeroes to get default action.  PLOT has its own set of commands and
        a HELP facility.
  70  1 FIT
           Enters least squares model fitting program. This has its own 
        interactive language and HELP command. A large number of models
        are available. Soon(?) you will be able to fit more than one linear
        data set simultaneously with overlapping parameters.
  80  2 SETUP
             Allows new input or output files, so there is no need
        to exit the progam to switch to another data file. Enter zero
        to just list currently opened files.
  90  4 STOP
            Use this for a graceful exit from the program, don't forget to
        PRINT MON.LIS to the lineprinter if the monitor might contain
        useful information. It should provide a record of what you did on
        the screen. Tidy up any output files, note that on a VAX their names
        default to FOR00n.DAT, where n is a channel number, if they were not
        assigned elsewhere.
  90  4 QUIT
            Same as STOP
