# FISH

## Data fitting program for small-angle scattering

The program is best suited to the fitting of a curve with a relatively large number of data points by a model with a few parameters. There are presently some eighty available models, mostly concerned with the fitting of small angle scattering data, though others such as polynomial fitting and peak fitting are of more general use, as are the graphics routines.


## Acknowledgements

A number of contributors are thanked for allowing inclusion of their own routines or for making modifications or additions to some parts of the code. These include C. Fagotti, J. Penfold, J. Hayter, A. Mackie, A. North, W.S. Howells and H. Stanley. Major contributions are acknowledged in the FORTRAN code and in the appropriate parts of this manual. References to formulae in the scientific literature are given where relevant. These should be consulted for the limitations and interpretation of the theories applied.

A particular acknowledgement goes to J. Rawle for work conducted on the FISH Java interface and all the associated work required to make this work, taking FISH from the command line and into a graphical user interface.
